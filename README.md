Hi, my name is Wolfgang Enzi and I am interested in bayesian statistics, data visualization, galaxy formation, gravitational lensing and dark matter.
In my previous work as a researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching I studied the nature of dark matter 
with the use of gravitational lensing. In 2021, I recieved my Ph.D. at the Ludwig Maximilians Universität München.
